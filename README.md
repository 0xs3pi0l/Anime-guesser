# Anime-guesser

This very simple project was realized to get a basic understading of how to work with APIs. It uses the [animechan](https://animechan.vercel.app/) API to fetch some data and display it on screen. The user has to guess the title of the [anime](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) the quote was taken from.
